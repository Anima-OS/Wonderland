wingo is an X window manager written in pure Go that supports floating and
tiling window placement policies. It is mostly EWMH and ICCCM compliant. Its
"unique" features are per-monitor workspaces and support for both floating and
automatic placement policies (where neither is an after thought).

There is more documentation/guides/compliance in the project directory.

Usage:
	wingo-cmd [flags]

The flags are:
	--replace
		When set, Wingo will attempt to replace the currently running window
		manager. This does NOT change your default window manager or edit any
		files. The worst thing that can happen is X crashing.
	--config-dir directory
		When set, Wingo will always try to read configuration files in the
		directory specified first. (Wingo will otherwise default to
		$HOME/.config/wingo or /etc/xdg/wingo.)
	--write-config
		When set, Wingo will write a fresh set of default configuration files
		to $HOME/.config/wingo and then exit. Wingo will NOT write any files
		if $HOME/.config/wingo already exists (to prevent accidentally
		overwriting an existing configuration).
	-p num-cpus
		The maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously.
		By default, this is set to the number of CPUs detected by the Go
		runtime. Anecdotally, Wingo feels snappier in this case. When debugging
		however, this should be set to '1' in order to see stack traces in
		their entirety if Wingo crashes.
	--log-level level
		The logging level of Wingo. Valid values are 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. Higher
		numbers result in more logging. When running normally, this should be
		set to 2, which includes errors and warnings. When debugging, this
		should be set to 3, which includes messages that usually are emitted
		in certain state transitions. (The log level 4 is probably too much for
		most uses, but it will include messages about hooks matching or not
		matching.)
	--log-colors
		When set, the log output will highlight errors and warning differently
		from other text using terminal escape sequences.
	--cpuprofile prof-file
		When set, a CPU profile will be written to prof-file when Wingo exits.
